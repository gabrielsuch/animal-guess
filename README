*** ANIMAL GUESS
A very simple machine learning over a guessing game.

The program implements a binary tree playing an interactive guessing game, where the computer asks about characteristics of animals and gets smarter each time it is played.

I have implemented it just as a exercise to practise and learn the Scala language.
