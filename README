ANIMAL GUESS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gabrielsuch/animal-guess.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gabrielsuch/animal-guess)
=========
A very simple machine learning over a guessing game.

The program implements a binary tree playing an interactive guessing game, where the computer asks about characteristics of animals and gets smarter each time that it is played.

I have implemented it just as a exercise to practise and to learn the Scala language.
